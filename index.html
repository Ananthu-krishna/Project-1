<P><h3>Best school in trivandrum In 1885, a normal school was started in Thiruvananthapuram by the government of Travancore for training male teachers. It was situated in the compound where St.Joseph's Higher Secondary school is at present. In 1903 it was shifted to Thycaud. The magnificent main building of the school, an example of European architecture, was built in 1910[2] during the reign of Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal Ramavarma.[3]
The first headmaster was Dr. C F Clarke who served for three years. He lived on the school campus; the house where he stayed remains as Clarke's Bungalow. One of the earliest headmasters of the training college was Shri. P.G. Sadasiva Iyer, who was an M.A. in Chemistry from the Madras Presidency college. The school was the city's first English, Malayalam, Tamil medium school.</h3></center>
<h1><p> Higher secondary school</p></h1>
<h3>When the Kerala State Board of Education decided to move the two-year intermediate course (the course between high school and university) from colleges to schools in 1998, Model School was part of the program. As part of this change, the name of the school was changed to Government Model Higher Secondary School.</h3></P>
